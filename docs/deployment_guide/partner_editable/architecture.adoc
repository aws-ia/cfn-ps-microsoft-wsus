.Partner Solution architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/image1.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A VPC configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets, managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* In the private subnet, a Windows instance with the WSUS role configured on it. WSUS can then be managed by using either Systems Manager Automation or the traditional WSUS console.
* Optionally, a Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway) in an Auto Scaling group in the public subnets for remote access to the WSUS instance.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Partner Solution into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
